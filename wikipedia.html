          <strong>Web development</strong>is the work involved in developing a
          <b>website</b> for the <b>Internet (World Wide Web)</b> or an
          <b>intranet</b> (a private network).<sup>[1]</sup>Web development can
          range from developing a simple single
          <b>static page of plain text</b> to complex <b>web applications</b>,
          <b>electronic businesses</b>, and <b>social network</b> services. A
          more comprehensive list of tasks to which Web development commonly
          refers, may include
          <b>Web engineering, Web design, Web content development,</b> client
          liaison, <b>client-side/server-side scripting, Web server</b> and
          <b>network security</b> configuration, and
          <b>e-commerce </b>development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among Web professionals, "Web development" usually refers to the main
          non-design aspects of building Web sites: writing <b>markup</b> and
          <b> coding</b>.<sup>[2] </sup>Web development may use
          <b>content management systems (CMS)</b> to make content changes easier
          and available with basic technical skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          For larger organizations and businesses, Web development teams can
          consist of hundreds of people( <b>Web developers</b>) and follow
          standard methods like <b>Agile methodologies</b> while developing Web
          sites.<sup>[1]</sup> Smaller organizations may only require a single
          permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related
          job positions such as a <b>graphic designer</b> or
          <b>information systems</b> technician. Web development may be a
          collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a
          designated department. There are three kinds of Web developer
          specialization: <b>front-end developer</b>, back-end developer, and
          full-stack developer.<sup>[3] </sup>Front-end developers are
          responsible for behavior and visuals that run in the user browser,
          while back-end developers deal with the servers. <sup>[4]</sup>Since
          the commercialization of the Web, the industry has boomed and has
          become one of the most used technologies ever.

        <h2>Evolution of the World Wide Web and web development</h2>
        <hr />
        <h3>Origin/ Web 1.0</h3>
        <p>
          <b> Tim Berners-Lee</b> created the <b> World Wide Web</b> in 1989 at
          CERN.
          <sup>[5]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary goal in the development of the Web was to fulfill the
          automated information-sharing needs of academics affiliated with
          institutions and various global organizations. Consequently,
          <b>HTML</b> was developed in 1993. <sup>[6]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Web 1.0 is described as the first paradigm wherein users could only
          view material and provide a small amount of information
          <sup>[7]</sup>Core protocols of web 1.0 were <b> HTTP</b>, HTML and
          <b>URI.</b>
          <sup>[8]</sup>
        </p>
        <h3>Web 3.0</h3>
        <p>
          Web 3.0, considered the third and current version of the web, was
          introduced in 2014. The concept envisions a complete redesign of the
          web. Key features include the integration of <b>metadata,</b>precise
          information delivery, and improved <b>user experiences</b> based on
          preferences, history, and interests. <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          Web 3.0 aims to turn the web into a sizable, organized database,
          providing more functionality than traditional search engines. Users
          can customize navigation based on their preferences, and the core
          ideas involve identifying data sources, connecting them for
          efficiency, and creating user profiles. <sup>[7]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
          This version is sometimes also known as <b>Semantic Web</b

        <h2>Evolution of web development technologies</h2>
        <p>
          The journey of web development technologies began with simple
          <b>HTML</b>pages in the early days of the internet. Over time,
          advancements led to the incorporation of <b>CSS </b>for styling and
          <b>JavaScript</b>for interactivity. This evolution transformed static
          websites into dynamic and responsive platforms, setting the stage for
          the complex and feature-rich web applications we have today.

          engineering methods, and application trends. <sup>[8]</sup>
